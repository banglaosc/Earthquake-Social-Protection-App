# 🌍 Earthquake Social Protection App

**A Hybrid (Web2 + Web3) Community Infrastructure for Post-Earthquake Safety & Coordination**

---

## 📌 What is this project?

This is an **open, non-commercial, community-driven application** designed to support **people after an earthquake**.

Earthquakes do not warn us—but what follows is often more dangerous:

* Communication breakdown
* Panic and misinformation
* Lack of coordination
* People being left alone despite available help

This project aims to create a **social protection layer**, powered by technology and human responsibility.

---

## 🎯 Core Goal

> Help people organize, communicate, and support each other **after** an earthquake — safely, quickly, and truthfully.

This is **not a government system**, and **not a replacement for emergency services**.
It is a **community-first coordination tool**.

---

## 🧠 Key Design Philosophy

* 🧍 Human-centered, not profit-centered
* 🔐 Privacy-first, minimal data
* 🤝 Community trust over centralized control
* 🧩 Simple tools during complex situations

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

```
User (Mobile / Web)
   │
   │ Wallet Signature (Identity Proof)
   │
Python Backend (Logic + Validation)
   │
   │ Verified & Processed Data
   │
Community Map / Dashboard
```

This is a **Hybrid Architecture**:

* **Web2 (Python)** for logic, data, and coordination
* **Web3 (Wallet signatures)** for identity and trust (NOT finance)

---

## 🔗 Why Web3 / Wallet Integration?

We do **not** use Web3 for tokens, trading, or payments.

We use it only for **decentralized identity**.

### Problem

* Phone numbers can be fake
* Social accounts can be fake
* KYC is impossible during disasters

### Solution

* A wallet signature proves:

  > “A real human sent this request”

No personal name required.
No funds required.
No mandatory gas spending.

---

## 🧩 Core Features (Planned)

### 🆘 1. Emergency Status Reporting

Users can report:

* "I am safe"
* "I need help"

Each report includes:

* Timestamp
* Approximate location
* Urgency level

Wallet signature ensures authenticity.

---

### 📍 2. Damage & Need Mapping

* Requests are grouped by area
* Duplicate requests are merged
* Heatmaps show critical zones

Helps volunteers and responders **see reality, not noise**.

---

### 👥 3. Volunteer & Helper Registry

Volunteers can register as:

* Medical helpers
* Transport providers
* Local coordinators

Backend matches helpers with needs based on:

* Distance
* Capability
* Availability

---

### 🧠 4. Rumor & Misinformation Control

* Unsigned information has limited reach
* Repeated verified reports increase trust
* Suspicious data is throttled, not censored

This creates **algorithmic trust**, not authority-based control.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety Principles

This project will **never**:

* ❌ Collect mandatory real names
* ❌ Store exact GPS permanently
* ❌ Handle user funds
* ❌ Auto-execute transactions

This project will **always**:

* ✅ Use minimal data
* ✅ Keep user control
* ✅ Respect consent

---

## 🐍 Tech Stack (Initial)

* **Backend:** Python
* **API:** Lightweight REST
* **Identity:** EVM-compatible wallet signatures (e.g., Binance Wallet)
* **Database:** To be decided (simple & resilient)
* **Frontend:** Low-bandwidth, mobile-first UI

---

## 🚀 MVP Roadmap

### Phase 1

* Emergency status submission
* Wallet signature verification
* Basic backend API

### Phase 2

* Location clustering & mapping
* Volunteer registration

### Phase 3

* Closed community testing
* Earthquake simulation drills

## 🤝 Who Can Contribute?

You do **not** need a degree.
You **do** need responsibility.

We welcome:

* Python developers
* Frontend developers
* Designers (UX for crisis situations)
* Data & mapping enthusiasts
* Communicators & social organizers

If you care about **people during disasters**, you belong here.

---

## 🌏 Scope

---

## 📣 How to Get Involved

Discussion & coordination currently happens via:

* Community posts
* Direct communication

(Official repository & contribution guidelines will follow.)

---

## ❤️ Final Note

Governments are important.
NGOs are important.

But during disasters,
**people helping people** is what saves lives.

If you believe:

> Technology is for people
> People are for people

Then this project needs you.
